# Functions

## " Functions are the paragraphs of programming " ~ Dr. P

### Lec1:
### Importance of functions
1.  Reuse.
2.  Encapsulation.
3.  Structure of code.

Structure of a function:

&lt type &gt &lt func_name &gt (&lt parameter_list &gt) {
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &lt declarations &gt
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &lt statements &gt
}
<br>
<br>

### Reference Book:

# " The heart of effective problem solving is problem decomposition. "

- Function is used for top-down method. (In top-down method, the problem is broken in high level and then starts diving deep)
- Can not be nested.
- Fuction Definition: *The C code that a function does*.

- If the type is void, then no value is returned.
	- If not, the value returned by the function will be converted.
- Body is a compound statement / block.


- Traditional function declaration is different (ANSI C compilers will accept it)

> Example for this kind of function declaration (old code samples) ?

- Uses of functions:
	1. Functions are **self documenting** and **highly readable**.
