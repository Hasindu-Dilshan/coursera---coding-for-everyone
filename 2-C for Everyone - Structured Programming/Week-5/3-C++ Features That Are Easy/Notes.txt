"auto" keyword
--------------
Ex:
auto i = 3;

- Called "duck typing".
- Useful when types get very complicated.

STL - Standard Template Library
-------------------------------
- Add many container classes (Ex: Lists, Stacks, Vector)
- Algorithms for using

Vector
------
- A powerful, flexible and efficient generalization of the array.

Ex:
   int a[N];
   Becomes
   vector <int> a(N);

*** NOTE
--------
- In  C++ is used to infer type as in  auto x = 2.0;  means x is double.
